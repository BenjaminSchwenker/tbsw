/** Class Det
 *  
 *  Base class for pixel detector planes in tbsw.
 *  
 *  The Det class provides a user interface for detector information to 
 *  reconstruction algorithms and Marlin processors. In order to provide 
 *  support for new detector types, developers must override all  
 *  pure virtual members.   
 *    
 *  The Det class contains some objects with a special meaning in tbsw: 
 *     
 *  1) The SensorID index is unique for a pixel detector in a telescope. This number must be the same as the sensorID 
 *     stored in LCIO::TrackerRawData and LCIO::TrackerData collections.  
 * 
 *  2) The sensitive area is divided in non overlapping geometrical pixels addressed by an unique vCell/uCell index 
 *     pair. The indices must be integers in the bounding box [minU,maxU]x[minV,maxV]. 
 *     
 *  3) The vCell (uCell) ID increments in the along the v (u) axis of the local uvw sensor coordinate 
 *     system.  
 *  
 *  4) All pixels have an integer valued pixeltype. Pixels with identical type are copies of a protopixel
 *     placed a certain position on the sensor area, called the pixel center. 
 *  
 *  5) The outline (circumference) of a protopixel on the sensor are is approximated as a 2d polygon. In the 
 *     simplest case, this is just a square. 
 *   
 *  6) The nominal reference frame encodes the trafo from global xyz to local uvw coordinates. The nomal reference
 *     frame is first loaded from the gear file and, if available, updated from the alignment data base.
 *  
 *  Other global conventions in tbsw regarding the telescope geometry are detailed in TBDetector.h. 
 *
