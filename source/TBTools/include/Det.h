/** Class Det
 *  
 *  Base class for pixel detector planes in tbsw.
 *  
 *  The Det class provides a user interface for detector information to 
 *  reconstruction algorithms and Marlin processors. In order to provide 
 *  support for new detector types, developers must override all  
 *  pure virtual members.   
 *    
 *  The Det class contains some objects with a special meaning in tbsw: 
 *     
 *  1) The SensorID index is unique for a pixel detector in a telescope. This number must be the same as the sensorID 
 *     stored in LCIO::TrackerRawData and LCIO::TrackerData collections.  
 *     
 *  2) The vCell/uCell index pair is unique for a geometrical pixel on the pixel matrix. The indices 
 *     must be non negative integers for valid pixels. 
 *     
 *  3) The vCell (uCell) ID increments in the along the v (u) axis of the local uvw sensor coordinate 
 *     system. The numbering of cells starts at zero. 
 * 
 *  4) All pixels have an integer valued type. Pixel with the same type have an identical layout (pixel pitch, electrode 
       position and so forth) and are assumed to have the same spatial resolution.  
 *  
 *  5) The nominal reference frame encodes the trafo from global xyz to local uvw coordinates. The nomal reference
 *     frame is first loaded from the gear file and, if available, updated from the alignment data base.
 *  
 *  Other global conventions in tbsw regarding the telescope geometry are detailed in TBDetector.h.
