//! FastTracker Processor
/*! This processor performs track finding and track fitting in beam test 
 *  experiments. The processor allows a globel track finding in all sensors 
 *  specified in the gear file. Multiple hit collections can be specied as 
 *  as input data. The processor outputs a single track collection which can 
 *  be used in downstream processors. 
 *
 *  Track finder starts by registering all hits into the HitFactory. The HitFactory 
 *  sorts hits first by sensorID and assigns two indices to each hit. The HitID is a
 *  unique identifier for all hits in an event and will be used to find overlaps 
 *  between tracks. The SectorID assigns each hit to a small sector from a network of 
 *  sectors covering the full sensor area. The sector size can be optimized by the 
 *  user to speed up track finding. 
 *  
 *  The second step is to build seed tracks from a pair of sensors along the beam 
 *  line. The user is free to select any pair of sensors. In order to reduce combinatorial 
 *  background, the used can select of cut on the maximal angle between the direction 
 *  of the seed track and the telescope z axis, which is typically also the beam axis.  
 *  For track inside a magnetic field, the user has to provide an initial gues for the 
 *  particle momentum and charge. All seed tracks are followed through all sensor along 
 *  the beam line and compatible hits a picked up along the way. The user can impose cuts 
 *  on the minimum number of hits and misses. Track candidates passing all cuts are feed 
 *  into a 2pass Kalman filter and stored in a TrackCollector. Finally, a opitmal set of 
 *  non overlapping tracks is selected from the collector and stored in the final track 
 *  collection.
