//! FastTracker Processor
/*! This processor performs track finding and track fitting in beam test 
 *  experiments. The processor allows a track finding in all sensors 
 *  specified in the gear file. Multiple hit collections can be given as 
 *  as input. The processor outputs a single track collection which can 
 *  be used in downstream processors. 
 *
 *  Track finder starts by registering all hits into a HitStore. The HitStore 
 *  sorts hits first by sensorID and assigns two indices to each hit. The HitID is a
 *  unique identifier for all hits in an event and will be used to find overlaps 
 *  between tracks. The SectorID assigns each hit to a small sector from a network of 
 *  sectors covering the full sensor. The sectors are computed from the residual cuts 
 *  supplied as steering parameters. 
 *  
 *  The second step is to build seed tracks from  pairs of sensors along the beam 
 *  line. The user is free to select any pair of sensors. In order to reduce combinatorial 
 *  background, the user can select a cut on the maximal angle between the direction 
 *  of the seed track and the telescope z axis, which is typically also the beam axis.  
 *  For tracks inside a magnetic field, the user has to provide an initial gues for the 
 *  particle momentum and charge. All seed tracks are followed through all sensor along 
 *  the beam line and compatible hits are picked up. The user can impose cuts 
 *  on the minimum number of hits and misses. Track candidates passing all cuts are stored
 *  in a TrackCollector. Finally, a opitmal set of non overlapping tracks is selected from
 *  the collector and stored in the final track  collection.
