	<p>This section is where the processors are listed.</p>
	<p>On top are the active processors (the ones defined in the execute section of a steering file)</p>
	<p>In the middle the errors for the currently selected active processor are listed. You should<br>
	read this before editing a processor.</p>
	<p>At the bottom the inactive processors are listed.</p>

	<br><br><hr><a name="active"></a><h3> Active Processors </h3><br>
	<div align=center><img src="../images/procs_active.png" border=2></img></div><br>

	<p>This list is equivalent to the execute section of a marlin steering file.<br>
	If an active processor is marked as red it has errors. See the
	<a href="#errors"> Error Description for Active Processors </a> for details...</p>
	<p>You can move processors up and down to achieve the execution order that suits your needs.</p>
	<p>When you add a new processor of a certain type the default values are set in the processor<br>
	parameters as defined by the author of this processor.</p>
	<p>Tips:<br>
	You can change a processor's name by double-clicking on it's name.<br>
	You can edit a processor by double-clicking on it's type.<br></p>

	<br><br><hr><a name="errors"></a><h3> Error Description for selected Active Processor </h3><br>
	<div align=center><img src="../images/procs_errordesc.png" border=2></img></div><br>
	<p>These are the errors of the currently selected active processor. It is very useful to<br>
	read this information before editing the processor, because the collections it needs may be<br>
	in an inactive processor or in an active processor defined below the current selected one.</p>

	<br><br><hr><a name="inactive"></a><h3> Inactive Processors </h3><br>
	<div align=center><img src="../images/procs_inactive.png" border=2></img></div><br>
	<p>Inactive processors are processors specified in the body of a steering file<br>
	that are not defined in it's execute section.</p>
	<p>The ones that are marked as gray are uninstalled processors and cannot be edited.</p>
	<p>Notice that you should avoid editing inactive processors whenever possible, because in this way you don't take<br>
	advantage of the consistency checking performed by MarlinGUI. If you want to use an inactive processor<br>
	in Marlin you should activate it first and place it in the correct position before editing it.</p>
