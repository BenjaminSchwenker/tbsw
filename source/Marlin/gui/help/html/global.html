	    <h2> Global Section </h2><br><br>
	    <img src="../images/global_section.png" border=2></img>
	</div><br>
	<p>This section is equivalent to the global section of a marlin steering file.<br>
	The "LCIOFiles" parameter as you know it from the steering file's global parameters is shown here in a<br>
	dedicated section (Global Section LCIO Files) like you can see in the figure above.</p>

	<br><br><hr><a name="lciofiles"></a><h3> LCIO Files </h3><br>
	<div align=center><img src="../images/global_lciofiles.png" border=2></img></div><br>
	
	<p>This is the place where you add or remove LCIO files from the global section of your steering file.<br>
	For calibration purposes you might want to have a certain order in which the LCIO<br>
	files are read. This is the reason for the move up/down buttons.</p>
	<p>As files are added or removed the <a href="overview.html#lciocollections"> List of Collections found in LCIO Files </a></li>
	gets updated with the new collections<br> read and a consistency check is performed against the steering file to ensure
	that active processors do not loose<br> their consistency state after removing an LCIO file.</p>
	<p>When saving to an XML file the files listed here are automatically added to the global section's parameters in the<br>
	specified order.</p>
	<p>CWD: This is your Current Working Directory, i.o.w. the directory from where you've started MarlinGUI.<br>
	Please note that files that are on the same directory branch as the CWD are added with relative paths.<br>
	Other files are added with absolute path.</p>

	<br><br><hr><a name="parameters"></a><h3> Global Parameters </h3><br>
	<div align=center><img src="../images/global_parameters.png" border=2></img></div><br>

	<p>This are the global parameters as defined in the steering file.<br>
	The LCIO files parameter is not shown here because it has a dedicated section (see above).</p>
	<p>If the GEAR file is marked as red (like in the figure above) it means that the file doesn't exist or<br>
	the link is not valid anymore. You can easily change the file with the appropriate "Browse for GEAR File" button.</p>
