	<p>As you can see in the image above there is a grid of conditions on the left of the active processors.</p>
	<p>In this grid you can check or uncheck conditions for each processor. This means, the checked conditions for<br>
	a certain processor, are the conditions that have to be fulfilled for the processor to be executed. So, it is<br>
	obvious that the single conditions affecting a single processor are, in the correspondent boolean algebra expression,<br>
	joint by the AND ("&&") operator.</p>
	<p>As conditions are added or removed in the <a href="conditions.html#edit">Edit Conditions List</a> section this grid is
	automatically updated.</p>
	
	<p>Tip: For selecting all items in a column try double-clicking on the respective column header ;-)</p>
	<p>You should first have the active processors in a consistent state before applying conditions.</p>

	<div align=center><img src="../images/procs_condedit.png" border=2></img></div><br>

	<p>Here you can add/edit or remove conditions. As you add or remove conditions new columns are added/removed in
	the <a href="conditions.html#grid">Grid of Conditions</a> section.<br> The conditions are indexed by numbers
	in the grid section, but you can resize the column headers to see the condition if you want.</p>
