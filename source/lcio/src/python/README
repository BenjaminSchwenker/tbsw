OVERVIEW

This is the source directory for the Python wrappers to LCIO.  The Python code
and the wrapper library are built from scratch using the lcio_swig.i 
interface file. 

TOOLS 

The build process uses gcc and make, both of which are required to build the
C++ libraries.  Additionally, recent swig and python executables are required.

This is my working setup on Linux.

gcc    - 3.2.3
python - 2.4.2
swig   - 1.3.28

Other combinations of these tools may or may not work.  The Swig version seems
especially important as the C++ support has been continually improving.  I recommend
building or installing a fresh copy if your site's installation is not current.

Only recent versions of Swig will work. Some Linux distributions, like 
Scientific Linux 3 and RHEL 3, come with default Swig versions that are very
old (1.1.x), and these DO NOT WORK with the LCIO .i file.   

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

These environment variables will either be picked-up by the Makefile from the environment
or guessed based on the swig and python exectables.

SWIG
How is Swig called from the command line?
Defaults to 'swig'

PYTHON
How is Python called from the command line?
Defaults to 'python'

PYTHONHOME
Where is Python's home dir?
Defaults to one directory up from the python executable

PYTHONVER
Python version in form '#.#'.
Defaults to version from output of 'python -V'

PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR
What is the directory that contains 'Python.h'?
Defaults to $(PYTHONHOME)/include/python$(PYTHONVER) 

PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR
Where should the Python binding be installed?
Defaults to $(PYTHONHOME)/lib/python$(PYTHONVER)

INSTALLATION

Once the environment is configured, type 'make' from LCIO/src/python to 
build the wrapper and install the following files into PYTHONHOME.  

_lcio.so  - LCIO wrapper library
lcio.py   - python binding
lcio.pyc  - byte-compiled python binding

Only _lcio.so is required at runtime, as the sio and lcio libs 
from the C++ build are statically compiled into the wrapper library.

TESTING

The lcio module is imported with the python statement 'import lcio'.

The files starting with 'test' are a few basic examples of using the wrapper.
