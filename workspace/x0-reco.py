This is an example script to demonstrate how TBSW can be used to create an X0 image from a 
test beam experiment.

The script assumes data was taken with the EUDET/AIDA tracking telescope in a monoenergetic beam.
In order to calibrate the tracking telescope, it is necessary to take data with no scattering object
placed in between the telescope arm. This situation is called an air run. The next step is to 
calibrate the X0 measurements by putting a series of Al plates with known thicknesses in between 
the telesocpe arms. After the x0 calibration data was taken, the scattering object to be studied can be 
placed in the telescope. Neither the beam energy nor the telescope planes should be touched in between 
these runs. 

The script has four main steps: 

1) Telescope calibration: Hot pixel masking, telescope alignment and cluster calibration (only from air run)
2) Angle reconstruction: Reconstruction of kink angles on the scattering object (from all runs: air, Al, DUT)   
3) X0 calibration: Obtain X0 calibration constants using X0 calibraiton runs (all runs with known scatterer) 
4) X0 imaging: Obtain calibrated X0 images of unknown scattering objects   

The script must be modified by most users to their specific use case. Places where such modifications 
are needed are commented in the text below. Examples for such modifactions are the pathes to the rawdata
files, settings for beam energy and the definition of objects used for the X0 calibration. 

Example .raw files from a X0 test beam can be downloaded. First create a directory (for example at 
'./rawdata') where they are stored. Afterwards download the files:

mkdir rawdata
wget -O ./rawdata/run006958.raw  https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/NKdExF0pgz4G3UA/download
wget -O ./rawdata/run006965.raw  https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/7a3SXRqHGVTOQnn/download
wget -O ./rawdata/run006973.raw  https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/DkiJTIaHSJWgXgf/download

Take into account that the total size of these files is ~3 GB and the download may take a while.

The runs have three different targets: Air (run006973.raw), 0.5mm (run006958.raw) and 1mm (run006965.raw) 
of aluminium. These three runs can be directly used to perform a X/X0 analysis with this script.

The steering files for in order to process this test beam is shipped with tbsw and 
can be found at steering-files/x0-tb-oct16. 

Usage: 

python x0-reco.py --startStep 1 --stopStep 4

Have fun with X0 imaging.

# Definition of the calibration tag. It is typically named after telescope setup, beam energy, x0calibration target etc.
# The caltag is used to generate a directory under localDB/*caltag* where all calibration parameters are stored
# in local DB files. Additionally DQM plots of the calibration steps will be stored under results/ to cross check the
# calibration results. The telescope calibration step (Step 1 in the enumeration above) will generate a hotpixel mask (NoiseDB-M26.root),
# a files with alignment information (alignmentDB.root) and a data base containing cluster resolutions (clusterDB-M26.root). DQM plots
# of the cluster calibration are stored under results/clusterDB-M26/*caltag*. Other track based DQM plots such as track p values,
# pulls and the mean number of tracks per event are stored for example in results/TelescopeDQM2/*caltag*.
# During the radiation length calibration step (Step 3) the beam energy, the beam energy gradients and a global offset of the telescope
# angle resolution will be determined and stored in a text file (x0cal_result.cfg). The DQM plots such as a selfconsistency diagram and
# angle distributions with their associated fits can be found in results/x0calibrationDQM/*caltag*.
