"""
This is an example script to demonstrate how TBSW can be used to create an X0 image from a simulated
test beam experiment.

The script below simulates a test beam experiment where charged tracks from a monoenergetic beam 
cross a misaligned pixel telescope containing six Mimosa 26 detector planes. Two data sets are 
simulated. A first 'air' run is done with no additional scatterer between the telescope arms. The 
'air' run is used to calibrate the telescope. In a second 'aluminium' run, a aluminium plate with 
a well known thickness profile is inserted in between the telescope arms. This second run is used 
to compute a X0 image from the reconstructed scattering angles. The known X/X0 of the Al plate is 
used to calibrate the beam energy and the angular resolution of the telescope. This second step 
completes the calibration of the telescope for X0 imaging.

# Definition of the calibration tag. It is typically named after telescope setup, beam energy, x0calibration target etc.
# The caltag is used to generate a directory under localDB/*caltag* where all calibration parameters are stored
# in local DB files. Additionally DQM plots of the calibration steps will be stored under results/ to cross check the
# calibration results. The telescope calibration step (Step 1 in the enumeration above) will generate a hotpixel mask (NoiseDB-M26.root),
# a files with alignment information (alignmentDB.root) and a data base containing cluster resolutions (clusterDB-M26.root). DQM plots
# of the cluster calibration are stored under results/clusterDB-M26/*caltag*. Other track based DQM plots such as track p values,
# pulls and the mean number of tracks per event are stored for example in results/TelescopeDQM2/*caltag*.
# During the radiation length calibration step (Step 3) the beam energy, the beam energy gradients and a global offset of the telescope
# angle resolution will be determined and stored in a text file (x0cal_result.cfg). The DQM plots such as a selfconsistency diagram and
# angle distributions with their associated fits can be found in results/x0calibrationDQM/*caltag*.
